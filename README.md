# AmazScrape-Mobile-Explorer
AmazScrape Mobile Explorer is a Python-based web scraping tool using Selenium, designed to extract valuable information about mobile phones available on Amazon India. The script navigates through the Amazon website, searches for mobile phones under a specified price range, and compiles relevant data, including mobile names and prices. The scraped data is then organized into a pandas DataFrame and exported to a CSV file for further analysis or integration into other applications.
